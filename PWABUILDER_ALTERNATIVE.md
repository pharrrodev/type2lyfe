# üöÄ PWABuilder Alternative - Easier Path to Play Store!

**Status:** Bubblewrap has technical issues (Gradle daemon crash)  
**Solution:** Use PWABuilder instead - much easier!  
**Time:** 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes

---

## ‚ùå Why Bubblewrap Failed

The Gradle build daemon crashed due to memory issues on Windows. This is a known issue that requires:
- More RAM allocation
- Java heap size configuration
- Gradle daemon tweaks

**Instead of fixing all that, let's use PWABuilder!** ‚úÖ

## üîó Digital Asset Links (Important!)

For TWA to work without browser UI, you need to set up Digital Asset Links.

### **Get SHA-256 Fingerprint**
PWABuilder will show you the SHA-256 fingerprint in the downloaded package. It's in a text file.

### **Update assetlinks.json**
File already created at: `frontend/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT` with the actual fingerprint from PWABuilder.

Example:
```json
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "com.pharrrodev.type2lyfe",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
      "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99"
    ]
  }
}]
```

### **Deploy**
```powershell
git add frontend/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json
git commit -m "Add Digital Asset Links for TWA"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy. Verify at:
https://type2lyfe.vercel.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json
